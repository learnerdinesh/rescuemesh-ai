# RescueMesh AI 

> "A decentralized agentic swarm for real-time disaster intelligence."

## What Is This?

RescueMesh is an open concept for a distributed, resilient AI network 
for disaster response — where citizens, NGOs, governments, drones, and 
edge devices contribute compute and local data during crises.

This repository is intentionally open. The goal is not ownership — 
it's for this idea to reach the right people and get built.
If you want to explore, fork, prototype, or critique — please do.
